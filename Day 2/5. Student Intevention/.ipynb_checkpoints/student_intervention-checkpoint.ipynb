    "The predictive performance of SVMs is slightly better than Naive Bayes. However, it is important to note how SVMs' computational time would grow much faster than Naive Bayes with more data, and our costs would increase exponentially when we have more students. On the other hand, Naive Bayes' computational time would grow linearly with more data, and our cost would not rise as fast. Hence, Naive Bayes offers a good alternative to SVMs taking into account its performance on a small dataset and on a potentially large and growing dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consequently, we compare Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression. Although the results show Logistic Regression is slightly worst than Naive Bayes in terms of it predictive performance, slight tuning of Logistic Regression's model would easily yield much better predictive performance compare to Naive Bayes. This is in contrast to Naive Bayes where we do not have the opportunity to tune model. Hence, we should go with Logistic Regression."
